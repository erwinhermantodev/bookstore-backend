Sure, I can provide you with sample `curl` commands for each endpoint. Here they are:

#### Books Endpoints
1. **Fetch all books:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/books
```

2. **Fetch book by ID (replace `<book_id>` with actual book ID):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/books/<book_id>
```

3. **Create a new book:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"New Book","writer":"Author","cover_image":"https://example.com/image.jpg","point":10,"tags":["fiction"]}' http://localhost:5000/books
```

4. **Update book (replace `<book_id>` with actual book ID):**
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Updated Title","writer":"Updated Author","cover_image":"https://example.com/updated_image.jpg","point":15,"tags":["fiction","novel"]}' http://localhost:5000/books/<book_id>
```

5. **Delete book (replace `<book_id>` with actual book ID):**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/books/<book_id>
```

#### Customers Endpoints
1. **Fetch all customers:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/customers
```

2. **Fetch customer by ID (replace `<customer_id>` with actual customer ID):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/customers/<customer_id>
```

3. **Create a new customer:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"John Doe"}' http://localhost:5000/customers
```

4. **Update customer (replace `<customer_id>` with actual customer ID):**
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Updated Name","points":150}' http://localhost:5000/customers/<customer_id>
```

5. **Delete customer (replace `<customer_id>` with actual customer ID):**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/customers/<customer_id>
```

#### Orders Endpoints
1. **Fetch all orders:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/orders
```

2. **Create a new order (replace `<book_id>` with actual book ID):**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"bookId":<book_id>}' http://localhost:5000/orders
```

3. **Cancel order (replace `<order_id>` with actual order ID):**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/orders/<order_id>
```

Replace `<book_id>`, `<customer_id>`, and `<order_id>` with actual IDs when making requests.

These `curl` commands can be used to interact with your backend APIs from the command line.
